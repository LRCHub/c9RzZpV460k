Mystery Babylon, Your Queendom has
Fallen (to the ground)
And Ra'ab, a Ethiopa is callin'

Gimme back mi gold, mi ruby and diamond

Mystery Babylon, Your Queendom has
Fallen (to the ground)
And Ra'ab, a Ethiopa is callin'

Send my sons and daughters back home
All them who call out jah jah name

Take back ya pound, ya schilling and dollar
Take back ya chink, ya roach and mosquito
