[00:07.35] The underdogs are my lions
[00:10.98] The silent ones are my choir
[00:14.52] The women will be my soldiers
[00:17.62] With the weight of life on their shoulders
[00:38.62] 
[00:21.83] Drink until you've had enough
[00:25.68] I'll drink from your hands
[00:29.23] I will be your warrior
[00:33.00] I will be your lamb
[00:42.50] 
[00:50.52] 'Til queendom come
[00:54.43] 'Til queendom come
[00:57.68] My queendom come
[01:01.67] My queendom come
[01:09.67] 
[01:06.35] The sea waves are my evening gown
[01:09.69] And the sun on my head is my crown
[01:13.73] I made this queendom on my own
[01:16.87] And all the mountains are my throne
[01:34.37] 
[01:21.06] Drink until you've had enough
[01:24.85] I'll drink from your hands
[01:28.63] I will be your warrior
[01:31.95] I will be your lamb
[01:41.45] 
[01:49.54] 'Til queendom come
[01:53.30] 'Til queendom come
[01:56.66] My queendom come
[02:00.67] My queendom come
[02:08.67] 
[02:11.81] My queendom come
[02:15.49] My queendom come
[02:23.49] 
[02:20.65] I hunt the grounds for empathy
[02:24.31] And hate the way it hides from me
[02:27.94] With care and thirst I have become
[02:31.61] You have a home in my queendom
[02:35.47] You have a home in my queendom
[02:39.19] You have a place in my queendom
[02:42.79] You have a home
[02:50.29] 
[02:48.79] 'Til queendom come
[02:52.32] 'Til queendom come
[02:55.73] My queendom come
[02:59.78] My queendom come
[03:03.35] My queendom come
[03:07.04] My queendom come
[03:10.70] My queendom come
[03:14.59] My queendom come
[03:18.22] My queendom come
