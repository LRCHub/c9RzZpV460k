You sure you want to start
What can't be undone?
If you light my spark
I'll burn hotter than the sun

If you unleash the beast
I won't be contained
You bet I will feast
And breathe fire on what remained

You have been warned
Welcome to my queendom

Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my queendom

Lesson number one
Don't trust anyone
Lesson number two
Don't let me get to you
Lesson number three
Rewrite your story
Lesson number four
Think twice before you open the door

You have been warned
Welcome to my queendom

Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my, Welcome to my
Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my queendom

I'll teach, I'll teach
I'll teach you the art of
War, war
War, war

They can run but they cannot hide
Can't you tell I'm twisted inside
They can run but they cannot hide
Can't you tell I'm twisted inside
Oh

Welcome to my queendom
Oh

Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my queendom
Welcome to my, Welcome to my, Welcome to my
War, War
